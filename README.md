These projects were completed as part of Udacity's Deep Learning nanodegree. They include: 

1) creating a neural net from scratch to predict bike-sharing patterns
2) using a convolutional net to classify dog breeds -- or to classify a human face into the "closest" dog breed
3) using LSTMs and word embeddings to generate Sainfeld movie scripts
4) using a GAN to generate faces 
5) trainign an LSTM-based model for sentiment analysis on IMDB movie review data and deploying it as a basic web app using SageMaker
